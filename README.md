## snag.rake

Clears the navigation snags that occur after cloning with parent/child element relationships. Not a product fix, but an interim solution to help get projects out the door, and builders piece of mind. Will iterate over all pages and flush child/parent relationships, then clear out them empty box snags, that will funk up a corp nav on a location (single domain). The builder will be responsible for resetting all page elements.
